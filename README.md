# Unsolved Problems
the algorithm that checks for connected castle pieces does not handle for two castles that are on a tile but are not connected. Because the algorithm returns on a broken castle, if one of the castles were not complete, the function would end before getting a chance to check the second castle.
Check for comleted castles is buggy, large castles seem to believe they are complete and assign points before they are actually complete.
